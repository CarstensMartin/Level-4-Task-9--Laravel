# Level 4 Task 9 -Laravel

## NOTE

For the purpose of showing my project I uploaded 1 file location up. In practice I will CD into "Task 1 - Blog" and commit from there, which will exclude the git ignore files

## Task

Extend the blog you’ve built so far to show actual blog posts.

● Create a route of the form /blog/{id} to view a specific blog post by id.

● Create a view that renders the title, content and date created of a blog post. Have the appropriate routing function render the view by passing in the appropriate record from the database.

● Update the home page blog post listings to include links to those specific posts.
